Development of a Fully Automated "Bean to Cup" Coffee Machine.

* PID Controlled Water Heater
* Coffee Grinder with load cell hopper to allow customized mass dosing.
* Scale integrated into drip tray to measure the actual extracted mass.

I have used the components of an old Jura Impressa F70 that I dismantled, since the logic board was broken, but the periheral were still in good shape.
